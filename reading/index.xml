      <description>I blew through Lipsky&amp;rsquo;s book on David Foster Wallace in two sittings. The times that Lipsky inserted himself or his thoughts was distracting, but it was great to dive into Wallace&amp;rsquo;s head for a nice chunk of time. I was happy with how ended, it would have been easy to be morose, but instead I was left with much happier memories. I like thinking about how much DFW was enjoying the process of writing and how he was looking forward to working for a good length of time.</description>

      <description>Counting down the weeks to finish up with classes. Hopefully when finished my available reading time will increase. My plans this year include knocking out a list of books that have been gathering dust on the shelves for a few years (I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you Thomas Wolfe).

      <guid>http://mjladd.github.io/reading/2006-12-31-reading/</guid>
      <description>Summary: Since I had accumulated a huge backlog of unread books, I had planned out my reading for the entire year. A minimum of a book a week.
Update: I got dragged down by a couple of slow books (I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you Thomas Friedman) and school took up a lot of time, I missed by goal by about 14 books.

      <description>Summary:
I remember thinking that I needed to start learning more of the business world, so I drifted a bit away from fiction. Not too many new discoveries, but writers like TC Boyle continued to put out solid books.

      <description>Summary:
I left the old job and moved up near Chicago. I was an IT department of one, trying to upgrade and entire office by myself. I&amp;rsquo;m surprised that I had enough time to read the books that I did. I didn&amp;rsquo;t run across many new authors this year, but did manage to read more Richard Yates.

      <description>Summary:
2003 was the year I finally got back into Literature. There were even several short trips to Indianapolis to load up on used books. The end of my work days were usually spent at a bookstore, either studying or reading. I remember being in school and thinking just how happy I would be to make enough money to afford coffee and a book whenever I wanted.

      <description>Summary:
I finally wised up, left Florida and went back to my old gig. It was a big transition year, and I finally decided that I was going to do the IT thing and give up on academia. I had a lot of insights into the college gig thing and was incredibly disappointed.

      <description>Summary:
I was still in Florida, but my time was coming to an end. After a very disappointing first year at school, I attempted one more year, hoping that the teaching opportunity would help. It was good to finally get into writers such as Richard Russo and Michael Chabon.

      <description>Summary:
While work was going well, I was still trying to find a school for a PhD program. I got accepted into what looked like a decent program and left work to live in Florida.

      <guid>http://mjladd.github.io/reading/1999-12-31-reading/</guid>
      <description>Summary:
1999 was full of changes. I had finished off the masters program in a year and a half. I had committed to working at a music camp over the summer where I consumed the entire David Foster Wallace collection. I also spent some time traveling and finally had to make a career decision. Although I was accepted into a PhD program, I couldn&amp;rsquo;t come up with the funds, so into IT I went.</description>

      <description>Summary:
1997 was an insanely busy year. I spent most of the time preparing for my solo recital, as well as working three jobs at a time while maintaining a full course load. I was living in a great house that I never saw, and spent up to 50-60 hours a week at the recording studio.

      <description>Summary:
I can&amp;rsquo;t remember what finally got me into Raymond Carver, but he&amp;rsquo;s by far my favorite short-story writer. I remember 1995 as being a very confusing time, and I went through a huge variety of writers that year.

      <guid>http://mjladd.github.io/reading/1994-12-31-reading/</guid>
      <description>Summary:
1994 was more of the same, but I started diving into a large number of musician&amp;rsquo;s biographies. It was the first summer that I spent away from home in my first apartment. My roommate and I both worked in restaurants and took classes during the day. I would often hide out in the school library for the free air-conditioning.

      <guid>http://mjladd.github.io/reading/1993-12-31-reading/</guid>
      <description>Summary:
1993 was an incredible year for finally having the chance to read so many authors that I&amp;rsquo;ve only heard about. I remember spending my typical Friday evenings at college at the Library until it closed at 7:00 pm, and then heading home with a pile of books by Hunter Thompson, Hubert Selby, or Charles Bukowski. I would hole up in my dorm room with a fresh pot of coffee and read for four to five hours before heading out for more typical college fun.</description>
