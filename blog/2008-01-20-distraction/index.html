<p>Every once in awhile I get the urge to dive back into music, to load up the laptop with music software and start being creative again. I blame it on two things; feeling like what I do now is not creative, and my brain trying to keep me from doing what I should be doing (in this case, homework).</p>
<p>Since school has turned into a somewhat useless exercise in going through the motions, my brain is trying to save itself from boredom. Calculating the traffic intensity of base stations is not all that thrilling. The pathetic part is that the music I used to create doesn&rsquo;t even interest me anymore. Knowing how simple it is to create most music has taking away alot of the excitement I used to have. What used to really interest me was the development of new sounds and experimenting with audio synthesis. There&rsquo;s been hardly anything new in that area for at least 10 years, and the same sounds and processes are pretty deadening. I suppose most of the work has moved onto subtle improvements rather than ground-breaking experiments.</p>
