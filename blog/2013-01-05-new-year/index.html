<p>2012 was a pretty hard year to catorize and looking back at music/book purchases it seems to be one of continuously paring down the unnecessary.</p>
<p>For that last 5-6 years I&rsquo;ve been working to puchase less to make sure that I actually read and listen to what I own. There are the occasionnal trigger purchases, but many fewer than before. I am trying to pare down, reduce and throw away that which is unnecessary.</p>
<p>The house took a great deal of work for the summer. I spent a lot of time busting out concreate and fixing the lawn. The drought took out a lot of my work, but I&rsquo;m pretty happy with the results. This year will be more of that work with a back porch that needs to go.</p>
<p>I did manage to work on an EP of music that I hadn&rsquo;t planned on. I had gone a solid year with dismissing everything that I wrote. I was happy to put in the time and get a bit of music down before life got busy.</p>
<p>The little one was the focus for the last part of the year. It&rsquo;s been great, hard, challenging and rewarding. Jen is the real champion and I&rsquo;m just the side-kick for now.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m planning for 2013 to be a year of less consumption and more production. I have a todo list focusing on new work, reducing the useless and moving everything forward.</p>
