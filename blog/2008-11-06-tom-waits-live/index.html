<p>There&rsquo;s a very short list of musicians that I care to see live. The live environment involves people, and people generally ruin everything. Tom Waits is on that very short list. I&rsquo;ve been a fan of Mr. Waits since the fall of 1992, borrowing a tape of &lsquo;Bone Machine&rsquo; from Jason Guski (sp?) and reveling in the harshness of &lsquo;Earth Died Screaming&rsquo; and &lsquo;Goin out West&rsquo; as well as the heartbreaking performances of &lsquo;Little Rain&rsquo; and &lsquo;Who Are You&rsquo;. I went on to accumulate the entire Wait&rsquo;s collection. Mr. Waits&rsquo; music has always been with me.</p>
<p>Note: while waiting for the show to start, we noticed a gentleman taking the stairs to the upper balcony dressed in an old suit, with a full beard and his hair wrapped in a clip to to the back of his head. I said to my brother, &ldquo;That&rsquo;s Jim James.&rdquo; The lead singer for My Morning Jacket was there, and we actually had better seats then he had. It took a bit of restraint to not go and become an annoying fanboy (MMJ is one of my top five bands at the moment, and their work gets better with every release).</p>
<p>It was a great show and I feel very lucky to have been able to see him live. The duet performance (piano and bass) of &lsquo;Tom Traubert&rsquo;s Blues&rsquo; was incredible, the audience became silent and and reverential and I&rsquo;m sure there were a few tears shed during that tune.</p>
