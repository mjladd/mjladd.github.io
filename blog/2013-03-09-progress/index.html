<p>Two months down in 2013 and I like to check in with year goals and progress. The primary priorities this year are coding and math. I&rsquo;ve pushed aside reading aside from lunch hours and have done almost nothing with music. Spare time is so minimal now, I have to make the most with what little there is.</p>
<p>By the end of day, after dinner, cleanup, a bit of time with the little one, I have maybe an hour to work. I&rsquo;ve been spending most of this time working on code. I have completed codecademy work in both ruby and python. I think I&rsquo;m to the point where I need to stop doing little excercises and start working on something real in order to learn anything.</p>
<p>Math progress is much slower. Everytime I dig in I find myself going backwards and finding more and more of what I have forgotten. I&rsquo;m looking to find the most practical and useful applications, but many of the tutorials use primary concepts that I&rsquo;ve long forgotten. I still get the panic when looking at a page of symbols that I have no framework for. So I continue to go backwards and do more exercises to try and remember so much forgotten work.</p>
<p>I am happy with the focus and discipline. Priorities are much clearer now and answering the question of what next is simple. Although progress is slow, persistence is all I have now. Marking off each day of the chain by doing &lsquo;something&rsquo; and having the confidence that this is all building into something I can only start to envision.</p>
