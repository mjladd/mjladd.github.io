<p>Probably the most difficult life adjustment I&rsquo;ve had to make with the little on is accepting that I have to cut corners in everything I do. Every meal has to be cooked as quickly as possible. There&rsquo;s no time to clean up a paint job, or make another pass at weeding a flowerbed. Life is completely timeboxed and if I want to take more than and hour or so on something I have to get up earlier or stay up later.</p>
<p>It is a constant reminder of perfection being the enemy of good, but most of the time I feel like most things end up half-assed and I&rsquo;m not proud of the results. It is similiar to being pulled in too many directions at work. One can stay afloat, but they won&rsquo;t get much closer to shore.</p>
