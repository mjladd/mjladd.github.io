<p>I&rsquo;ve been thinking alot about operations lately, how to move forward and how to keep people intersted in the work that they do.</p>
<p>One of concepts that makes me really respect how esty performs is their focus. They seems to have a great ability to focus on a core set of software and development processes and not be distracted by every new option that comes along. There is a constant stream of new software, ideas, new libraries, etc &hellip; that offers a better, simpler, shinier way to do something. I am impressed by the discipline of Etsy to remain true to what they feel is the right way to operate while still being undeniably successful.</p>
<p>I think it is the process of debt and support that keeps my options limited (in a good way). Every new thing must be maintained, monitoring and upgraded. This quickly stretches out the ability of a team to keep up on necessary security and configuration issues. I think every new thing must be defensible in its addition and all the better when it can be offered with the retirement of something old.</p>
