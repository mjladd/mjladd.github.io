<p>I&rsquo;ve been on a big David Simon kick since I&rsquo;ve been re-watching &lsquo;The Wire&rsquo; with Jen. Although it took me a few episodes to dig in when I watched it the first time, I (like many folks) became enamored without the show. Critical acclaim naming the best TV Series ever is not to be dismissed.</p>
<p>The side affect of &ldquo;The Wire&rdquo; (for myself) is being unable to watch any other cop-related programming without a fair amount of teeth gritting at the low quality writing and ridiculous plot lines.</p>
<p>Simon&rsquo;s show &ldquo;Generation Kill&rdquo; had the same effect on me when attempting to watch &ldquo;The Green Zone&rdquo;. Generation Kill showed a view of the Iraq War from an embedded journalist and how misconstrued so many of the efforts were. The voices of the soldiers felt real and true. Hearing lines like &ldquo;Get your game face on&rdquo; from Matt Damon in &ldquo;The Green Zone&rdquo; just made me wince. I made it about 30 minutes before giving up.</p>
<p>From a technical nerd standpoint, I love the way that Simon (or rather the directors he chooses) uses sound and visuals. Music is very rarely used unless it comes from a real source; a car radio, or music appropriate for the environment. GZ (like many hollywood films) uses silly, obvious music to tell you exactly how you should feel, &ldquo;this is tension, this is drama&rdquo; rather than letting the actors tell the story. GZ also uses the nausea inducing shaky-cam which makes me physically bothered (I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised, the director, Paul Greengrass made the unwatchable Bourne films) . David Simon uses the camera to highlight the content and not obscure it. With few exceptions, Simon focuses on story above all.</p>
<p>The results of quality is showing how far the bar can be raising by demonstrating the results of a valiant effort and commitment to telling a story in the truest way possible. &ldquo;The Green Zone&rdquo; was a hackneyed story with  mediocre performances.</p>
