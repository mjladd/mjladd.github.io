<p>Every year I come up with a crazy workout goal to keep things interesting. A couple of years ago it was going through Eric Cresey&rsquo;s plan and last year it was going through Dave Tate&rsquo;s Strong(e)r workout series (which ironically didn&rsquo;t leave me stronger, but I think it did improve overall physical fitness).</p>
<p>These are the totals from the last time I tested max lifts.</p>
<pre><code>Bench    335
Squat    375
Deadlift 385
        1095
</code></pre>
<p>This year I want to push those three lifts to either hit or get close to 400 lbs.</p>
<pre><code>Bench    365
Squat    405
Deadlift 425
        1195 - Just shy of the 1200 lb club
</code></pre>
<p>Not great numbers for a powerlifter, but not awful for a mid-30s computer geek.</p>
<p>The workout plan will be close to Wendler&rsquo;s 5-3-1 workout with an emphasis on assistance exercises that focus on grip strength (my biggest deadlift weakness) and lower-back health. I&rsquo;m codetty confident in the squat and deadlift goals, but benching makes me nervous since I don&rsquo;t have a spotter.  Once you get 300+ lbs balanced over your throat you better be codetty confident that you&rsquo;ll be able to push it back up.</p>
