<p>Getting older has made recovery times slower and a couple of injuries are forcing me to slow down. I&rsquo;m committed to taking time off now that will allow me to return to heavier lifting in about a year. My goal is to continue lifting until at least 45 yrs old. I&rsquo;ve hit most of my lifting goals with the exception of a 500 lb deadlift (I was at least two years away from that).</p>
<p>So now I&rsquo;m going to focus on recovery and conditioning with two of my new best friends; the kettlebell and interval timer. Rather than pulling 400 lbs off the floor, I&rsquo;m struggling to perform a 45 lb turkish get up and doing timed kettlebell swings. It really is an ego check.</p>
<p>Over the last few months, I&rsquo;ve dropped 28 lbs and I&rsquo;ll likely have to shop for new clothes since I&rsquo;m starting to swim in my own shirts. It sucks, but I&rsquo;m making the best of it. It&rsquo;s a minor bump and will soon fade.</p>
