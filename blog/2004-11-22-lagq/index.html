<p>While browsing the local Sunday paper, I happend to see that the Los Angeles Guitar Quartet was performing in town that evening.</p>
<p>The concert was at the University of Chicago campus, w/ the poor directions we were given, we enjoyed a nice tour of the south-side of Chicago. There are a few rough areas down there. When we hit Comiskey Park, we don&rsquo;t even hit the local restaurants.</p>
<p>After a couple of detours, we managed to find street parking and grabbed a couple of available tix. Even feeling a bit old and out of place in the college environment, there were enough old folks so we didn&rsquo;t stand out too much.</p>
<p>They LAGQ played two nice sets, and were pretty tight for the most part. Some nice originals, and appropriate arrangements (aside from the Stravinsky, which doesn&rsquo;t seem to translate well to the guitar).</p>
<p>LAGQ is similar to the Kronos Quartet in the sense of being a bit more adventurous in their vocabulary then the standard ensembles.</p>
<p>I need to check out more music. There&rsquo;s always so much going on in this town, I need to make it more of a priority.</p>
