<p>Pretty good weekend, good to get away from thinking about work. With system administration, there&rsquo;s always the worry that something will break, and I&rsquo;ll miss an alert, and work will be a nightmare the moment I walk in. Being a small company, every little thing falls into either my lap, or James&rsquo;.</p>
<p>Phil came by and we got some decent Asian food and hung out for a bit playing cards. I threw &lsquo;Clerks&rsquo; on the DVD player for background noise. I hadn&rsquo;t seen it in awhile, but it brought back a few memories. I was lucky enough to be in school at a time when independent film was getting a bit of acclaim. &lsquo;Pulp Fiction&rsquo;, &lsquo;Killing Zoe&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Clerks&rsquo; came out in 1994 when I was living in my first apartment. I was able to catch other films like &lsquo;Roger and Me&rsquo;, &lsquo;Slacker&rsquo;, and &lsquo;Go Fish&rsquo; on video. I was lucky enough to have a roommate who was a film minor and got me into films such as &lsquo;Man Bites Dog&rsquo;, &lsquo;Delicatessen&rsquo; , and the work of Kieslowski (&lsquo;Trois Couleurs&rsquo;) and Errol Morris (&lsquo;Thin Blue Line&rsquo;).</p>
<p>I feel lucky since it was a time when independent music was still getting some acclaim and independent film was really taking off. It was a good time to be in school, and around folks who had similar interests.</p>
