<p>Started reading this last night, and it immediately took my back to my hometown. Michael has returned to his hometown and becomes a volunteer fireman. It&rsquo;s a book that I wish I had an afternoon to lose myself in.</p>
<p>Edit: I really like this line.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Working-class prejudice never quite shakes the idea of art as frivolity, and frivolity has pink-palms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coming from a small town, this was always something rolling around in my head while I was studying music. How useless it would seem at times.  I still have similar feelings about IT, questioning if I should be doing something that may have a more positive impact.</p>
