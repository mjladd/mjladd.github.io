<p>I&rsquo;ve been trying to spend my lunch hours at work reading. It&rsquo;s a nice break from IT and gives me time to use the part of my brain that isn&rsquo;t swearing at servers.</p>
<p>My brother passed along a section of Richard Russo&rsquo;s newest book a few weeks ago, and I just ran across it today. Pages 123-125 captures the most accurate telling of adolescence that I&rsquo;ve ever read. I couldn&rsquo;t get that section out of my head and went back to re-read it at least three times.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shared, all of us, a powerful sense that what was at stake on those crowded stairs was nothing less than the rest of our lives, that our every move in that gymnasium had an unimaginable significance, that we were being watched, judged, elected, or damned.&rdquo;</p>
