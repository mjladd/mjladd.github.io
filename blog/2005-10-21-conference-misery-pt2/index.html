<p>The last session of the first day was on &lsquo;Protecting Your Software Investment&rsquo;. The description of the session follows:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patching, Security (Internal and External) , Speed of Access, Disaster Preparedness, Data Recovery, Backup Options&rdquo;</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m a sucker for anything related to disaster recovery and security, so no matter how badly I really wanted to leave so I could go home and pass out in a Nyquil induced haze, I forced myself to attend. I was graciously rewarded with fountains of knowledge. While there was 75 minutes set aside for the presentation, it was drawn out to a painful 24 minutes.</p>
<p>Play-by-play:</p>
<ul>
<li>patching: only apply if necessary, so, uh, if not necessary, don&rsquo;t apply</li>
<li>security: use some antivirus product</li>
<li>speed of access: if things are slow, upgrade to gigabit</li>
<li>disaster preparedness: have a disaster recovery plan (described as, &ldquo;a list of things to do to recover in case of disaster&rdquo;)</li>
<li>data recovery: make backups</li>
<li>backup options: not discussed</li>
</ul>
<p>There was no discussion of how to patch, how to determine what constitutes a necessary patch, example DR plans, backup rotations, etc.</p>
<p>Ok, I need to let it go. It was only two days of my life gone to pot.</p>
