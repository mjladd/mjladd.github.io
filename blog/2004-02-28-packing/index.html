<p>Spent the day clearning out the room, and dumping everything into the basement. Tomorrow, the plan is to dig through the 13+ boxes of books, and hopefully find a few that can be disposed of. I&rsquo;m very particular w/ getting rid of books, they&rsquo;re tied to too many memories of where I was when I heard of a particular author, or when I read a particular book.</p>
<p>I remember the first time I finally found Bukowski and Selby in the Ball State libary. Books were much harder to locate back then, there was no Borders, Barns &amp; Noble, or amazon. I had to make the hour plus drive to Lafayette just to find something by Hunter S. Thompson or Mark Leyner. I haven&rsquo;t had all my books in a singular location in over a decade, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to filling a few bookshelves.</p>
<p>Still ripping music, filling up the 120 gig HDD on the file server. The amount of books and music I own is pretty staggering for someone who holds onto nothing of sentimental value. I relate to the world via music and text, it&rsquo;s all I got going for me.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to just digging into the new job and getting started, the feeling of waiting and anticipation drags me down and distracts me from current projects.</p>
<p>Spent a good deal of today thinking and planning. One thousand years from now, my life could be reconstructed from the endless To-Do lists that are constantly re-organized, re-edited, and re-prioritized.</p>
<p>Trying to get a couple more hours of work before passing out. I&rsquo;ve had a stack of DVDs that I need to get to some day. I havent&rsquo;t sat down and watched a movie in quite a few weeks.</p>
