<p>Spent the holiday weekend working on the yard. We tried to find landscape service, but they were all either too busy to return calls or continually canecelled meetings. Hence, DIY.</p>
<p>For the last two months, I raced home from work to shovel down a quick dinner and get outside and work until it turned dark. Everything from breaking up90 square feet of concrete to pulling out and endless number of daylillies.</p>
<p>With a half-day and an extra day off of work, I was able to knock out the last chunk of work. According to the fitbit, I put 26+ miles of walking w/out even leaving my yard. I put down around 9 cubic meters of soil and spread 22 cubic feet of mulch. I also built two raised garden beds and filled them with a mix of vegetables and flowes.</p>
<p>Now I get to wait out the grass seed and water and hope that I&rsquo;m not filling in my large dirt hole with sod in another month or so.</p>
