<p>My big reading project for this year was to read everything written by and about David Foster Wallace.  Here are the final stats:</p>
<ul>
<li>300+ journal articles (interviews, criticism, etc)</li>
<li>a few hundred hours of audiobooks, tributes and interviews</li>
<li>17 books (~5874 pages .. with Infinite Jest as 20% of the total effort)</li>
</ul>
<p>It was a good project, a lot of fun and a bit of a challenge to be in that mindset for nearly nine months of reading. It wasn&rsquo;t exclusive, I also made it through 25-30 other books so far this year.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s hard to put into words how DFW&rsquo;s writing makes me think and feel, to me he&rsquo;s a goddamned magician.</p>
<p>Every time I read &lsquo;Good Old Neon&rsquo; from Oblivion, I wait for the moment. It&rsquo;s never as good as it was the first time, because it&rsquo;s not the surprise that it once was. I remember the feeling, in the second floor of the Skokie Public Library, reading bits of &lsquo;Oblivion&rsquo; when I should have been studying for my MCSE.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s on page 180, about halfway through. The narrator is gone (literally) and perspective has shifted and I remember feeling as if I was floating, as if I was inside the story as a observer, just as the narrator  changed to the omniscient view and I saw myself as the character David Wallace.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a goddamned magic trick and I look each time for the misdirection, but never catch it. Now it&rsquo;s just anticipation and a humming inside my brain that I get when bearing witness to something truly good. It&rsquo;s art that connects and it feels like an amplifier on my own thoughts. It&rsquo;s the buzz I get from reading something good and worked over with and eye towards craftsmanship.</p>
<p>I get something similar from &ldquo;Everything is Green&rdquo;, but it&rsquo;s different. While &lsquo;GON&rsquo; is showy, its showy in a way that feels like a singular work, no one else could have written it and it&rsquo;s voice is individual. &lsquo;EIG&rsquo; hits me like the work of someone way too clever and is showing off how they can fill a story in so short of a space that still provides the reader with everything they need to know about the characters in three short pages.</p>
<p>Not all of his work has this magical moment, but I enjoy it when I catch it. It&rsquo;s what makes the effort worthwhile. The digging a little deeper below the surface to find the real art.</p>
