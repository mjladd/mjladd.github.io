<p>With the home purchase and wedding planning going on, there&rsquo;s been little time left for anything else. I&rsquo;ve been doing my best to keep up with my reading projects and making sure I hit the gym 3x a week, but anything else has pretty much been ignored.</p>
<p>As things have settled down and with the year half-over, it&rsquo;s time to reboot and replan. I have a hard time feeling like I&rsquo;m making any progress without some structure. So this week has been spent with pile of books, a yellow legal pad and things.app. I have a pretty good idea of how the rest of the year should work out in terms of goals.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m also happy to get a big project started at work, something I&rsquo;ve been working towards for the past few years. This will be a good opportunity to show off my ideas and prove that they work.</p>
