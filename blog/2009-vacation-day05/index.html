<p>Got up early and spent the day doing mostly touristy stuff. We started at the Arch early enough to beat the crowd. I&rsquo;ve been surprised at how few people we&rsquo;ve seen on vacation, short lines everywhere. The view was great and the trip up/down was cramped but not awful.</p>
<p>We headed out to the Botanical Gardens for a few hours and walked around. It was a pretty decent day weather-wise, but after a few hours it warmed up and my blood sugar crashed. We headed back to the Loop District to get lunch at Blueberry Hill. Got a pretty tasty burger there and the place had a nice group of displays, everything from Beatles dolls to Cardinals memorabilia.</p>
<p>After lunch we were both pretty wiped out, so we headed back to the hotel to nap/cool down and then spent an hour or so catching up on email and 1000+ RSS feeds. We then headed across the street to the stadium.  It was a beautiful night for baseball and a really good sized crowd (37k+).  Albert Pujuls knocked out two home-runs including a 454 footer.  Several former White Sox (Aaron Rowand and Juan Uribe) and now on the San Francisco Giants, so we rooted against the home team.  It&rsquo;s a really great park and should look sharp on TV for the All-Star game in another week-and-a-half. There was a guy sitting next to us who had drove from Pittsburg to see the game, he is hitting four games in four days and then on to a few west coast games. Nice way to spend a few weeks in the summer.</p>
