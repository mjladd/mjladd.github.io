<p>Back on the road with a four-hour trip to St. Louis. The drive was beautiful and went through the Hoosier National Forrest. We headed directly to the Loop District since we couldn&rsquo;t check in for a couple of hours. We had a good lunch at Fitz&rsquo;s (mighty solid root-beer and creme soda on tap) and stopped at a Subterranean Books (nice bookstore with a small but decent selection).  We walked around most of the Loop District as well as finding a branch of Left-Bank Books which was also small but hosted an appropriate collection of books.</p>
<p>After finding our way around the city (a lot of which looks like a bomb struck recently, pretty run-down city) we checked in to the hotel. The hotel room was nice and had a great view of the city and the stadium. We walked around the area and couldn&rsquo;t locate anything decent for dinner (it was down to Hooters or Hardee&rsquo;s), but we did see a guy try to break into two cars and shadow someone into the entrance of a condo. We holed up in the room and ordered some miserable local pizza. The special included a salad that was (no kidding) a pile of iceberg lettuce with a few strands of cheese on top.  The food was a low-point in St. Louis and we spent a lot of time looking for anything better.</p>
