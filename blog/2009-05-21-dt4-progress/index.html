<p>Finished a track last night, &lsquo;Passing&rsquo;, three left to go. Hopefully I&rsquo;ll finish them this weekend and take the next week to mix and hopefully master next weekend. I&rsquo;m listening to some of the tracks that I finished months ago and I&rsquo;m reasonably happy with them.  I&rsquo;m trying some new ideas and they have a different sound than the last project.</p>
<p>I like getting up early to get work done but sometimes at night when I&rsquo;m on a roll I start to get some anxiety about getting enough sleep to hit the gym in the morning. The workouts are the priority, they keep me sane and I guess health benefits are worthwhile.</p>
<p>Starting to plan the next workout phase post vacation. It&rsquo;ll be good to have a week away from the gym and recover. It will also give me a chance to really beat myself up for the ten days or so prior to leaving.  Workout facilities at hotels are usually pretty sparse but we usually end up doing a ton of walking.</p>
<p>First softball game tonight, should be fun. I haven&rsquo;t done much interacting in a non-work environment for the last 5-7 years so it&rsquo;s bit of a challenge to try and remember names and how normal people interact. My lousy jokes and non-sequetor references seem to get little-to-no response. I have to remind myself that not everyone has memorized every line from Arrested Development.</p>
