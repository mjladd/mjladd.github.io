<p>Hit a personal record of 405 deadlift this morning. I wasn&rsquo;t planning on maxing out, I had done a pretty heavy squat set two days earlier and my hamstrings were pretty sore. I had also only had about five hours of sleep, so conditions were less than ideal.  I ended up feeling pretty strong after a few warm up sets and decided to go for it.</p>
<p>I still want to add about 20 lbs by the end of the year and I&rsquo;m starting to feel optimistic that I may reach my goal. My grip strength has been the biggest weak point, so I&rsquo;ve been working a lot on my grip and lower back strength and it&rsquo;s been paying off.</p>
<p>I get a nice adrenaline buzz when I really push myself with heavy lifts. I had the headphones going and I was able to concentrate even with a half-dozen or so ladies gabbing away right in front of me. I&rsquo;ve been pretty happy with my progress this summer. I haven&rsquo;t made a lot of big leaps, but it&rsquo;s been pretty steady growth with a reduced amount of pain.</p>
