<p>Deprived of water, the human body decays rapidly; within days the lips vanish (as if amputated), the gums blacken, the nose withers to half its length, and the skin contracts around the eyes to the degree that it becomes impossible to blink.</p>
<p>The water we drink has been around since the earth was young. By 3.8 billion years ago the oceans had basically achieved their current volume.</p>
<p>Water is incredibly fluid (pun), the molecular bond is strong enough to flow uphill when siphoned and cause pain from a belly flop , but weak enough to separate when diving into a pool.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve found something amazing on nearly every page of this book. I may have to grab the audio book to listen to in the car. There&rsquo;s so much information I can&rsquo;t absorb it all at once.</p>
