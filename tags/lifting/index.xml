      <description>I missed nearly a month of gym time due to shoulder surgery, but I tried to be in the best possible shape going into the procedure. Over the summer I did nearly two months of two-a-day workouts and lifted up until the day of getting sliced (8/10/07). Just about a month later (9/6/07) I was ok&amp;rsquo;d to go back to the gym, and went in 20 lbs lighter and much weaker.</description>
